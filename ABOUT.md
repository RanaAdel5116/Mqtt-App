# My code is written with android studio and Java since i have 4 years experince in Java and OOP and 2 years experience in android studio.

# Wanted to accomplish
I wanted to accomplish with my application is to open the application to find all the connections are listed and then to create new connection and setup its options or to choose one connection to start publishing messages to a certain topic or subscribing topics .

# Thought process 
First of all i needed to understand 'What is MQTT' so i google it and learned about MQTT,then i learned how the Paho Android Service can be added to an application via Gradle and then i started to design and implement this application with android studio and java.
